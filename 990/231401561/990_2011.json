Services are provided to all who need them, regardless of ability to pay. Emergency services are provided 24/7, 365 days a year, without inquiry into financial means or insurance status. Elective services are provided with financial assistance offered based upon a standard, objective application to determine financial need. Services may be discounted from established rates or provided free of charge after the application and supporting documentation have been evaluated. Discounts and allowances offered under the medical centers financial assistance program totaled $259,608 based on charges foregone during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The amount of the discount is determined by the type of service received such as inpatient, outpatient, etc. Interest-free payment plans are made available for patients who cannot pay in full at the time of service. In addition to specifically identifiable charges discounted or forgiven entirely, FCMC provides numerous services in the community at reduced or no cost to address unmet healthcare needs. There are three K-12 school districts in the county, all of which are visited several times each school year to conduct health screenings, child safety training, and health and hygiene educational programs, etc. The home health agency of FCMC offers a regular schedule of medical screenings to adults and senior citizens within the community such as blood pressure checks and glucose and cholesterol screenings in conjunction with the laboratory services department.FCMC holds numerous community health fairs, both alone and in conjunction with other providers in the area. The arrival of autumn signals the annual \"Healthy Sportsman Fair\" which is attended by hundreds for a wide variety of health screenings offered at nominal or no cost. October (to coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness Month) brings a week-long healthy woman event which focuses on the specific needs of females. FCMC also provides various screenings at an annual health fair sponsored by the local FQHC to meet the needs of citizens of all ages and economic means.Fulton County Medical Center purposefully provides services at a loss as part of its mission to meet the medical needs of the community. These services include diabetes and nutritional educational education, pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation services, which are provided at a loss since many patients have exhausted any available insurance benefits, and tobacco cessation and prevention services, which had traditionally been provided by a state-funded grant. These services are now provided on a fee-for-service basis, and FCMC has continued to provide extensive services even though the revenues received no longer cover the full cost of providing them. Fulton County Medical Center also hosts a specialty clinic, where a variety of physician and mid-level specialists see patients on a rotating basis. The costs of operating and staffing this clinic are not met by revenues. Local residents, particularly the elderly and those with chronic medical conditions, are grateful for the opportunity to see qualified specialists without traveling over the mountainous area for distances of 30-50 miles or more for these services.", "TotalProgramServiceExpense": "27338440", "DescribedIn501C3": {"@referenceDocumentId": "RetDoc1039100001", "#text": "1"}, "ScheduleBRequired":
