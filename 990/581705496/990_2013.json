If a client is pregnant, the CCPC's counselors present the pros and cons of parenting, adoption and abortion. Truth and genuine love help break the power of fear. As we genuinely love our clients, we see the power of fear broken. This allows them to make a pregnancy plan based on worth, hope and love. Because we value all life, we never refer for abortion. Clients who have a negative pregnancy test are compassionately counseled about underlying emotional issues and STD's.The CCPC is a place that facilitates emotional and spiritual healing from the underlying issues that contributed to the unplanned pregnancy as well as providing essentials like maternity and baby clothes, diapers, formula, car seats and pack and plays. We provide in-depth, peer-counseling from the first appointment to years after the baby is born, as well as prenatal and parenting classes, educational scholarships, mentoring, Bible Studies, and referrals. This same compassionate support is extended to the client's family, the father of the baby and his family as well. The community that we serve is among the most vulnerable members of society. Infants are born to young women most of whom are uninsured, low-income, and poorly educated. Many have grown up in very broken homes filled with violence, neglect, abuse and drugs. We estimate that 75% of our clients are in abusive relationships themselves. Most of our clients have no vision of health, genuine love, worth or dignity. We believe that these young women, their babies, and others involved have great worth! Because of this, we seek to transform this community from chaos to health and wholeness. We endeavor to care for underlying emotional /mental issues of this community by walking for years with them; to build trust with each person who enters our doors and to unconditionally love them. This foundation is essential as we help them prepare for birth and parenting. The cycles of abuse and neglect must be broken and replaced with love.In calendar year 2012, the CCPC staff served 1161 clients through 3,438 visits in our pregnancy program. Many who felt hopeless and afraid experienced love, real presence, compassion and very practical care. 100% of those evaluated felt genuinely loved, understood, and cared for. Love and genuine care enabled 100% of our evaluated pregnant clients to feel better equipped to make a decision regarding their pregnancy. The power of fear was often broken. 819 babies and/or their moms received maternity and baby clothes and other essential baby items. 135 times clients took either prenatal or parenting classes at the CCPC equipping them to emotionally and physically better parent their child.", "Activity2": {"Expense": "135269", "Description": "The Pure Life Abstinence Education Program presents truth to the community in public and private schools, youth groups, and other settings. The purpose of the program is to reduce teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases by educating teenagers, parents, and the community about the risks that accompany sexual activity outside of marriage. By presenting an abstinence-only message in area schools, we are able to impart the truth of each individual's intrinsic value and worth. Students learn vital decision-making skills to help insure a successful future. For those who have already been sexually active, there is hope in the message of future abstinence. The Pure Life program's unique components are designed to provide the maximum impact on 6th - 12th grade students. The Pure Life program provides:- One to five day in-depth classroom presentations or school assemblies designed to educate students about teen pregnancies, STDs, healthy relationships, and the influence of drugs and alcohol on decision-making. During 2012, 731 presentations were made to 29,410 students and 759 adults. This program is the sole abstinence-only educational program in the local schools. Pre- and post-presentation surveys conducted by the CCPC staff indicate that 23% of our high schoolers state that they are sexually active. Of those who are sexually active, 79% said after hearing the Pure Life presentation, they would change their behavior and become abstinent until marriage."}, "Activity3": {"Expense": "20914", "Description": "Through our Abortion Recovery Program, we seek to minister healing to those who have experienced abortion. Our safe and confidential in-depth peer-counseling program aids in the healing process. Many men and women experience painful, long-term emotional and/or spiritual issues after being involved in an abortion. Those suffering from Post-Abortion Stress may exhibit long-term grief, anger, guilt, flashbacks, suicidal thoughts, increased alcohol and drug use, as well as difficulty maintaining close relationships. They may feel like no one will understand if they tell about what happened. They often feel afraid to tell anyone for fear of being shamed or rejected. We value the life of each man or woman who comes, for help and healing. We do not judge or condemn, but instead we share the love of Christ. Our Bible Study program walks people through the process of understanding and accepting God's forgiveness and immense love."}, "TotalProgramServiceExpense": "593755", "DescribedIn501C3":
