In recognition of the contribution that each executive makes to the success of AHS, AHS provides to eligible executives participation in the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to offer eligible executives an opportunity to elect from among a variety of supplemental benefits, including deferred compensation benefits taxable under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457(f), to individually tailor a benefits program appropriate to each executive's needs. The Plan provides eligible participants a pre-determined benefits allowance credit that is equal to a percentage of the executive's base pay from which is deducted the cost of mandatory and elective employee benefits. The pre-determined benefits allowance credit percentage is approved by the AHS Board Strategy & Compensation Committee, an independent committee of the Board of Directors of AHSSHC. Any funds that remain after the cost of mandatory and elective benefits are subtracted from the pre-determined benefits annual amount are contributed, at the employee's option, to either an IRC 457(f) deferred compensation account or to an IRC 457(b) eligible deferred compensation plan. The Plan documents define an employee who is eligible to participate in the Plan to generally include the Chief Executive Officers of AHS entities and Vice Presidents of all AHS entities whose base salary is at least $196,000. The Plan provides for a class year vesting schedule (2 years for each class year) with respect to amounts accumulated in the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account. Distributions could also be made from the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account upon attainment of age 65 or upon an involuntary separation. The account is forfeited by the executive upon a voluntary separation. In addition to the Plan, AHS has instituted a defined benefit, non-tax-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives who have provided lengthy service to AHS and/or to other Seventh-Day Adventist Church hospital or health care institutions. Participation in the plan is offered to AHS executives on a prorata schedule beginning with 20 years of service as an employee of AHS and/or another hospital or health care institution controlled by the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and who satisfy certain other qualifying criteria. This supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) was designed to provide eligible executives with the economic equivalent of an annual income beginning at normal retirement age equal to 60% of the average of the participant's three highest years of base salary from AHS active employment inclusive of income from all other Seventh-Day Adventist Church healthcare employer-financed retirement income sources and investment income earned on those contributions through social security normal retirement age as defined in the plan. 457(f) Employer SERP Contributions Contr./Pymt Carlyle Walton $27,960 $0 Penny Johnson $10,194 $0"}, {"ReturnReference": "Part I, Line 6", "Explanation": "The filing organization's physician compensation formula is designed to result in total compensation that would be reasonable for each physician.

The filing organization utilizes national survey productivity, cost, and compensation data in formulating all aspects of the compensation plan. Physician compensation arrangements include a ceiling or reasonable maximum on the amount a physician may earn. The filing organization's employed physicians enter into a written agreement that requires the physicians to provide medical care to individuals who are referred by the filing organization.

The filing organization's compensation arrangement does not use a method of compensation that is based upon a percentage of the organization's net income.

AHSSHC is the parent organization of a healthcare system, known as Adventist Health System, that operates hospitals, nursing home facilities, and other healthcare provider organizations. AHSSHC is exempt from federal income tax under IRC Section 501(c)(3) pursuant to a group ruling issued to the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.

The Committee is composed of certain members of the Board of Directors (the Board) of AHSSHC.

The Committee's role is to review and approve all components of the executive compensation plan of AHSSHC. As an independent governing body with respect to executive compensation, it should be noted that the Committee will often confer in executive sessions on matters of compensation policy and policy changes. In such executive sessions, no members of management of AHSSHC are present. The Committee is advised by an independent third party compensation advisor. This advisor prepares all the benchmark studies for the Committee. Compensation levels are benchmarked with a national peer group of other not-for-profit healthcare systems and hospitals of similar size and complexity to AHS and each of its affiliated entities. The following principles guide the establishment of individual executive compensation: - The salary of the President/CEO of AHS will not exceed the 40th percentile of comparable salaries paid by similarly situated organizations; and - Other executive salaries shall be established using market medians. The compensation philosophy, policies, and practices of AHSSHC are consistent with the organization's faith-based mission and conform to applicable laws, regulations, and business practices. As a faith-based organization sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church (the Church), AHSSHC's philosophy and principles with respect to its executive compensation practices reflect the conservative approach of the Church's mission of service and were developed in counsel with the Church's leadership."}, {"ReturnReference": "Form 990, Part VI, Section C, line 19", "Explanation": "As discussed in our response to Question 15a & b in Section B of this Part VI, the filing organization is a part of the system of healthcare organizations known as Adventist Health System (AHS).
