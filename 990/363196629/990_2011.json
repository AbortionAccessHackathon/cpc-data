Charges, was used to calculate the amounts reported in the table for Part I, Line 7a. Schedule H Instructions, Worksheet 3, Unreimbursed Medicaid and Other Means-Tested Government Programs, was used to calculate the amounts reported in the table for Part I, Line 7b. A cost accounting system was used to determine the amounts reported in the table for Part I, Lines 7e, 7f, 7g, and 7i. Part VI, Line 1 - Description for Part I, Line 7g N/A Part VI, Line 1 - Description for Part I, Line 7h Advocate North Side Health Network conducts numerous research activities for the advancement of medical and health care services. However, the unreimbursed cost of such research activities is not readily determinable and no amount is being reported for purposes of the 2010 Form 990, Schedule H. Part VI, Line 1 - Description for Part I, Line 7, column (f) $27,148,626 of bad debt expense was included on Form 990, Part IX, line 25, column (A), but was removed from the denominator for purposes of Schedule H, Part I, Line 7, column (f). Part VI, Line 1 - Description for Part II N/A Part VI, Line 1 - Description for Part III, Line 4 The footnotes to Advocate Health Care Network and Subsidiaries' Audited Financial Statements do not specifically address bad debt expense; rather, the footnote describes Advocate's patient accounts receivable policy. Patient accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. Advocate North Side Health Network evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on the length of time the receivable is outstanding, payer class, historical collection experience, and trends in health care insurance programs. Accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for uncollectible accounts when they are deemed uncollectible. The costing methodology used in determining the amounts reported on lines 2 and 3 is based on the ratio of patient care cost to charges. The unreimbursed cost of bad debt was calculated by applying the organization's cost to charge ratio from the Medicare cost reports (CMS 2252-96 Worksheet C, Part 1, PPS Inpatient Ratios) to the organization's bad debt provision per generally accepted accounting principles, less any patient or third party payor payments received. Advocate North Side Health Network makes every effort to identify those patients who are eligible for charity care or other financial assistance by strictly adhering to its Charity Care policy. We believe that Advocate has a population of patients who are uninsured or underinsured but who do not complete the charity care assessment. The estimated amount of bad debt expense (at cost) which could be reasonably attributable to patients who would likely qualify for financial assistance under the organization's charity care policy, if sufficient information had been available to make a determination of their eligibility, was based upon self pay patient accounts which had amounts written off to bad debts. Our method was to use the cost to charge ratio multiplied by the amount of bad debt attributable to self pay accounts. This cost was then reduced by any payments posted to these accounts subsequent to year end. We believe this process, although it may understate the charity care, is a reasonable basis for our estimate. As we are only considering self-pay accounts written off to bad debt for this estimate, this estimate does not include the immediate 20% discount to charges which is applied to all self-pay patients. It also does not include account balances or co-pays of non-self pay accounts which are written off to bad debt when the patient has no other financial resources to pay these amounts and the patient does not apply for charity care. Bad debt amounts have been excluded from other community benefit amounts reported throughout Schedule H. Part VI, Line 1 - Description for Part III, Line 8 For Advocate North Side Health Network's hospital operations, the unreimbursed cost of Medicare was calculated by applying the organization's cost to charge ratio from the Medicare cost reports (CMS 2252-96 Worksheet C, Part 1, PPS Inpatient Ratios) and for non-hospital operations the cost to charge ratio calculated on worksheet 2 Ratio of Patient Care Cost to Charges to the organization's Medicare, less any patient or third party payor payments and/or contributions received that were designated for the payment of Medicare patient bills. Part VI, Line 1 - Description for Part III, Line 9b Advocate North Side Health Network maintains both written Charity Care and Bad Debt/Collection policies. The Bad Debt/Collection policy does not apply to those patients known to qualify for charity care or other financial assistance; therefore, such patients are not subject to collection practices. Part VI, Line 1 - Description for Part V Advocate North Side Health Network operates four outpatient sites of care. Part VI, Line 2 - Needs Assessment In an effort to help determine what types of programs and services would best fit the needs of the diverse community Advocate North Side Health Network serves, several data sources are examined annually, including inpatient hospitalization trends, prevalence of key risk factors and behaviors associated with the leading causes of death and hospitalization, and mortality rates associated with the highest volume of inpatient hospitalizations. A. Inpatient Hospitalization Trends An examination of inpatient hospitalizations by diagnosis identified the top ten services based on volume across the Advocate System: obstetrics, cardiac medicine, gastroenterology, pulmonary, orthopedics, pediatrics, general surgery, nephrology/urology, neurology, and cardiac surgery. These services represent the highest patient demand across the Advocate System and directly relate to diseases that are among the most prevalent in the country, according to national statistics. These services comprised nearly 71 percent of the total six-county metropolitan area discharges (over 111,000 patients) from Advocate facilities in 2010. By comparison, the same services comprise the majority of hospitalizations across the metropolitan area with only the order of ranking varying slightly. B. Mortality Rates and Prevalence Next, mortality rates and prevalence were examined. Heart disease and cancer are the top two causes of death among Illinois residents. The risk factor prevalence indicators above have been shown to directly impact many diseases, including heart disease and cancer. While many of the diseases are a result of controllable behaviors (smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise), others are hereditary and manageable with access to a health care professional and proper treatment. Reducing the risk factors above has been shown to be significant in eliminating health disparities, and improving the health status and quality of life. For this reason, Advocate's community screening programs are directed specifically at improving healthy behaviors as well as encouraging prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of leading health problems, such as stroke, heart disease, colon and lung cancers, and diabetes. Part VI, Line 3 - Patient Education of Eligibility for Assistance Advocate North Side Health Network assists patients with enrollment in government-supported programs for which they are eligible and in securing reimbursement from available third party resources. Financial counseling is provided to help patients identify and obtain payment from third parties, including Illinois Medicaid, Illinois Crime Victims Fund, etc., as well as to determine eligibility under Advocate North Side Health Network's Hospital Charity Care policy. Advocate utilizes a financial screening software program to help identify public assistance programs for which the patient may be eligible or Advocate's charity care at the time of registration or as soon as practicable thereafter. In addition, HealthAdvisor, Advocate's education registration and physician referral telephone center, serves as a community resource providing referrals to government-funded and other programs via telephone from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday. Advocate North Side Health Network assists patients with applying for Advocate's own financial assistance/charity care services, if patients are not eligible for government-supported programs. Advocate North Side Health Network communicates the availability of charity care in the applicable languages of the hospital community. Means of communication include: 1. The health care consent that is signed upon registration for hospital services includes a statement that financial counseling, including charity care consideration, is avail"}, {"Identifier": "Part VI, Line 4 - Community Information", "Explanation": "Advocate Health Care Network's primary service area covers the six-county, Chicago metropolitan area. These counties include Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will. Advocate North Side Health Network serves the community of Cook County. The population in Advocate's service area is described by the following demographic characteristics: total population, population by group, race/ethnic distribution and key socio-economic indicators. The Chicago metropolitan area is expected to continue to grow from 2010 to 2015, with the population reaching nearly 8.65 million people by 2015. While the overall area is expected to grow 1.7%, several of the collar counties will experience higher growth ranging from 9.7% (Kane County) to 12.1% (Will County). The 65+ age group is expected to have the largest increase in population (14.3%) from 2010 to 2015, followed by the 45-64 age group (5.1%). The 18-44 age group is expected to decline 3.2%, while the population aged 0-17 is expected to decrease slightly (.1%). While these are the trends across the overall metro area, the trends vary in great degree by county. A wide range of diversity exists among the communities served by each of our hospitals. The following table displays the racial/ethnic distribution of the population of the metro area. Asians and Hispanics are projected to continue to be the two fastest growing race/ethnic groups from 2010 to 2015 (12.7% and 11.4% growth expected, respectively).

In Cook County, nearly 22 percent of the households have a household income under the federal poverty level with annual incomes below the $25,000 threshold. In the collar counties, eight to twelve percent of the households are subsisting on less than $25,000 a year. Overall, the number of people (as well as the percent of total population) on Medicaid and uninsured has increased across the metropolitan area from 2007 to 2010. In households that are struggling economically, access to health care can be limited either because of a lack of services available within the market or because an individual's financial challenges deter that person from seeking care. Lack of preventive care or care for chronic illnesses brings more acutely ill patients to the hospital. County 2010%Total Households %2010 Pop.

Part VI, Line 5 - Promotion of Community Health Advocate North Side Health Network d/b/a Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center (AIMMC) was named an Everest Award winner and one of the nation's 100 Top Hospitals by Thomson Reuters. AIMMC, located on Chicago's north side, is one of the state's largest, most comprehensive nonprofit medical centers. The hospital has 408 licensed beds and has more than 880 active physicians. AIMMC is designated as a Level I trauma center and as a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) - the highest designations awarded by the state. AIMMC's Level I trauma center is one of only four trauma centers in Chicago. The hospital is nationally recognized for expertise in cardiac care and its use of the most innovative technologies available to provide advanced care with attention to patient safety, quality and excellence. AIMMC has also received Magnet recognition status for excellence in nursing services by the American Nurses Credentialing Center. As one of Illinois' largest non-university medical teaching hospitals, the hospital trains 200 residents and 500 medical students each year through its affiliations with the University of Illinois at Chicago Health Sciences Center, Rosalind Franklin University and Midwestern University. In addition to serving individuals in the acute care setting in 2010, AIMMC provided community outreach to over 555,000 people through health fairs, wellness programs and other outreach services designed and delivered to promote the health of the communities it serves. - AIMMC's school-based health centers located at Amundsen and Lake View High Schools on Chicago's north side offer health services to teenagers from low-income neighborhoods, reaching students more effectively because the services are in the school. During 2010, the centers served nearly 1,300 students for a total of over 4,300 individual medical and mental health visits, and nearly 6,000 visits in group encounters through workshops covering topics such as nutrition, reproductive health, domestic violence, tobacco use and substance abuse. The health centers serve the schools' communities with the goal of not only providing top quality, affordable and accessible health and mental health care, but also educating adolescents about being good consumers of health care services. - AIMMC recognized the need to increase the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community's access to important, but sensitive, health information. Written English text did not prove successful, so the hospital began using streaming video technology to provide information in American Sign Language (ASL). Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center produced videos about HIV/AIDS, breast health, sexually transmitted diseases, diabetes and smoking cessation and posted them on its Web site, so the videos could be viewed privately and at the convenience of the patient. The Web site also includes health screenings for anxiety, depression, heart disease, risk for HIV, and readiness to stop smoking - all communicated in ASL so deaf and hard of hearing people have access to preventive health tools. Over the years, Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center has distributed over 2,300 free ASL DVDs on HIV/AIDS, STDs, breast health, diabetes, depression and smoking cessation. - More than 40,000 members of Chicago's Latino community benefit from Hispanocare's community activities. Hispanocare is a network of over 150 bilingual and bicultural health care providers. Hispanocare's education and preventive services for the Latino community ensure access to quality bilingual, bicultural, low-cost health care. - The Mobile Dental Van offers access to oral health services to over 600 underserved and uninsured individuals each year. Providing dental screenings, treatment, and education, the mobile van regularly travels across the city of Chicago making stops at senior residences, schools and primary care clinics to provide care to hard-to-reach and underserved populations including elderly people with limited mobility, children from low-income families, disabled persons, immigrants and the homeless. The Mobile Dental Van services have resulted in significant reductions in diseased teeth among homeless populations served. - The Pediatric Development Center at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center offers a 12-month course of intensive, home-based intervention for children with autism between ages 2 to 6 years old. Integrating a variety of treatment approaches, program goals include organizing the home environment for successful parenting, developing a functional communication system for the child, teaching parents how to help their young child with autism to grow and learn, and prepared the child to take full advantage of special education. - The Asthma Learning Center provides adults and children with free education to help regulate their asthma. - The Diabetes Care Program has been recognized for its comprehensive, bilingual educational services. - The Creticos Cancer Center is home to the first hospital-based Gilda's Club in the U.S., offering support to cancer patients and their families. - As a respected member of the community, AIMMC representatives bring their expertise to the surrounding community by serving on area boards, councils, task forces and committees. AIMMC is not only actively involved with the area's chamber of commerce but, for example, a leadership team representative has served for several years on the Mayor of Chicago's Senior Wellness Task Force. Each year, the hospital also hosts quarterly community clergy functions and serves as a co-sponsor to the School Health Fair with State Senator Martinez and the Senior Health Fair with Chicago Alderman Tunney.

As part of its community benefits strategy and its mission, Advocate North Side Health Network [Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center (AIMMC) is the sole hospital in Advocate North Side Health Network] is committed to promoting initiatives that enhance access to health care for the uninsured and underinsured. An example of this is AIMMC's provision of charity care. AIMMC offers a very generous charity care program - requiring no payments from the patients most in need, and providing discounts to uninsured patients earning up to six times the federal poverty level and to insured patients earning up to four times the poverty level. Although AIMMC's Charity Care Policy is very generous, it continues to review and refine its policy in an ongoing effort to ensure that financial assistance is available to those who need help when they need it. AIMMC maintains highly visible signage and brochures in multiple languages to inform patients of the availability of financial help and financial counselors. Information about its charity care program and charity applications is provided to all uninsured patients during registration and as an insert in all uninsured patients' bills. In the area of Trauma care, AIMMC is dedicated to providing expert emergency care - today and in the future. AIMMC's Level I Trauma Center cares for the most seriously injured people in its service area. As is the case with all Illinois Level I Trauma Centers, AIMMC's trauma center is staffed by on-site, 24-hour-a-day trauma surgeons; featuring 24-hour surgical and nonsurgical services, such as radiology and anesthesia.

IN ADDITION TO SERVING INDIVIDUALS IN THE ACUTE CARE SETTING IN 2010, AIMMC PROVIDED COMMUNITY OUTREACH TO OVER 555,000 PEOPLE THROUGH HEALTH FAIRS, WELLNESS PROGRAMS AND OTHER OUTREACH SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF ITS MVP (MISSION, VALUES AND PHILOSOPHY). THE MISSION OF AIMMC IS TO SERVE THE HEALTH NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES THROUGH A WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY ROOTED IN THE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN BEINGS AS CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. THE VALUES OF AIMMC SERVE AS AN INTERNAL COMPASS TO GUIDE RELATIONSHIPS AND ACTIONS. THEY INCLUDE EQUALITY, COMPASSION, EXCELLENCE, PARTNERSHIP, AND STEWARDSHIP. THE PHILOSOPHY OF AIMMC IS GROUNDED IN PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN ECOLOGY, FAITH, AND COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH CARE. THESE PRINCIPLES ARISE FROM AN UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN BEINGS AS WHOLE PERSONS IN LIGHT OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, THEMSELVES, THEIR FAMILIES, AND THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY LIVE.

THE PLAN SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN ITS SERVICE AREA IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ITS PROGRAMS. AIMMC HAS SET FORTH THREE GOALS AND MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS STRATEGY. THE GOALS AND CORRESONDING EXAMPLES ARE PROVIDED BELOW: GOAL #1 - PROMOTE INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR THE UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED. CHARITY CARE - AIMMC OFFERS A VERY GENEROUS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM - REQUIRING NO PAYMENT FROM PATIENTS MOST IN NEED, AND PROVIDING DISCOUNTS TO UNINSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP TO SIX TIMES THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND TO INSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP TO FOUR TIMES THE POVERTY LEVEL. HISPANOCARE - MORE THAN 40,000 MEMBERS OF CHICAGO'S LATINO COMMUNITY BENEFIT FROM HISPANOCARE, A NETWORK OF OVER 150 BILINGUAL AND BICULTURAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS REPRESENTING NEARLY 300 OFFICE LOCATIONS. THE GOAL OF HISPANOCARE IS TO PROVIDE QUALITY, COST-EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE TO CHICAGO'S LATINO COMMUNITY IN A CULTURALLY SENSITIVE MANNER. TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN, HISPANOCARE PROVIDERS AGREE TO GIVE ENROLLEES A 20 PERCENT DISCOUNT ON ALL OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES. MOBILE DENTAL VAN - THE MOBILE DENTAL VAN OFFERS ACCESS TO ORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO OVER 600 UNDERSERVED AND UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS EACH YEAR.
