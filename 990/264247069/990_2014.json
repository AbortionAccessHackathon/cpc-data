THE RESIDENT MUST BE SOBER AT LEAST 90 DAYS BEFORE ENTRY AS WE ARE NOT A TREATMENT FACITIY AND DO NOT DO DETOX. WE HAVE 2 HOUSE MOMS, SO THERE IS SOMEONE ON DUTY AT ALL TIMES. TO DATE, WE HAVE SERVED SOME 5 WOMEN, AND CURRENTLY HAVE 5 WOMEN LIVING IN THE HOUSE. THREE OF THESE WOMEN CAME FROM DETENTION AND THE OTHER 2 HAD MAJOR LIFE EVENTS THAT MADE THEM TEMPORARILY HOMELESS. AS WE NOW HAVE THE EXPENSE OF A LEASE, UTILITIES, SALARY, ETC., EACH RESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO PAY AN APPLICATION FEE (250), HER 1ST MONTH RENT (400) AND AFTER OBTAINING EMPLOYMENT, RENT IS 600. MOST OF THE WOMEN SOLICIT SPONSORSHIPS FROM AREA CHURCHES OR INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN THEIR RECOVERY. WE DO FUNDRAISING ALSO TO PAY EXPENSES. OUR AIM IS FOR THE SHEPHERDS HOUSE TO BE A BEACON IN OUR VALLEY, A SAFE PLACE TO RECOVER FOR THE WOMEN, AND PROVIDE TOOLS SO THAT THEY CAN LIVE A BEAUTIFUL LIFE AND BE FUNCTIONING MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THE SHEPARDS HOUSE IS A FAITH BASED PROGRAM, OVERSEEN BY CHRISTIAN CHAPLAINS, AND THE BOARD OF HEART. THERE IS A STEERING COMMITTEE OF LIKE-MINDED WOMEN WHO PLAN AND DIRECT THE VISION FOR THE SHEPHERDS HOUSE AND HAVE INPUT ON THE DAILY SCHEDULE AND ACTIVITIES. THE ONLY PERSON COMPENSATED IS THE SENIOUR HOUSE MOM. EVERYONE ELSE, INCLUDING THE ADDICTION COUNSELOR, IS VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESS.
